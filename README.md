SEI-36 Project 1

Number-placement puzzle game 

## Technologies & Tools Used

## Description
Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle of which the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each row, column and each 3x3 subgrids that make up the full grid contain the digits 1-9 without any repeats.
The starting puzzle board provides a partially filled 9x9 grid, and has a single solution to it. 

Example of partially filled 9x9 grid: 



### How to play
The main objective of the game is to completely fill up the 9x9 grid without any repeats in the digits 1-9 in each row, column and 3x3 grid. 
The instructions to play are as follows:
- To place numbers in the grid, click any number from 1-9 from the buttons below the puzzle
- Once selected, click any tile to place the number chosen in the previous step
- To change the number, deselect the current number button and click on any new one to change the number
- Repeat previous steps until the board is filled
- Once the board is filled, click the "Check solution" button. If correct, the game will congratulate you. Otherwise, it will let you know that the solution is incorrect.

## Approach & Process
My original approach to the project was to start with settling all the functions in Javascript that I had planned to use and work on the HTML and CSS based on this afterwards.

***What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?*** <br>
I definitely did not anticipate the challenge behind some of the functions needed for the game to run even though I thought I had simplified it enough. 
Taking this into account, I think more research could have been done prior to starting the project and more thought could have been put into how to break down the game further too.

***What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?*** <br>
I felt that the goals I set for each day of the project timeframe were relatively attainable and were paced out well enough so that I could think about the next steps or logic behind the functions.

## Code & Code Design

***What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?*** <br>
I think I should definitely look towards simpler solutions instead of dumping everything inside a for loop or if conditional 


***What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?*** <br>
Coding based on a wireframe really helped! It gave me an end idea of how I wanted the game to look like and allowed me to brainstorm around it. 
I think doing up a wireframe or even drawing a rough sketch/outline of the end product helped me with breaking the project into smaller chunks and determining what might be needed each step of the way and I would probably do this again next time.

## SEI Post Mortem

### Habits I used during this unit that helped me: 
- Breaking down the problems into smaller parts first to test if it works e.g. working with one array instead of 9 arrays in an array
- Googling small problems and watching YouTube tutorials
- Asking for help when stuck 

 
### Habits that I have during this unit that I can improve on:
- Trying to apply things learned in class
- Overthinking my code and making it more complicated than it has to be
